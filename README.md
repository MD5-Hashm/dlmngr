Kinda bum dl manager ui a kinda bum ui that I made in a few hours for a hackathon that I was ridiculously unparpaired for

I might update further with more features... atm I have most of the features implemented in the backend but without enough knowledge with fyne/ui to implement such as progress, pausing, cancelling, sorting, etc

The ui uses fyne so you need a c compiler like gcc
